## Worksheets for Historical Data Analysis with R

This repository contains [worksheets](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/worksheets/) that I use in my teaching for classes such as "[Data and Visualization in Digital History](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/data-dh.2016/)" and "[Programming in History/New Media](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/)." These materials are also a supplement to my book in progress, *[Digital History Methods in R](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/dh-r/)*.
