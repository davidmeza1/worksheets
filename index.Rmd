title: About these worksheets

These worksheets are intended to give you practice doing historical data analysis using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). You are probably encountering them as an assignment from one of my classes, such as  "[Data and Visualization in Digital History](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/data-dh.2016/)" and "[Programming in History/New Media](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/)." These materials are also a supplement to my book in progress, *[Digital History Methods in R](http://lincolnmullen.com/projects/dh-r/)*.  

You can also get these worksheets from [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmullen/worksheets). To clone them to your own computer, use this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/lmullen/worksheets.git
```

## Assumptions

I'm going to assume that you have the most recent version of R installed on your computer. I'm also going to assume that you are using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), though you could use R on the command line without RStudio just fine.
